## Exclusion variables

- SoundCalibration: Check whether participants correctly heard sounds after sound calibration for this experiment. On this question participants who respond '1' were redirected to the next "Sound_Problem" question, whereas participants who respond '2' or '3' went directly to the Inattentional blindness task.
